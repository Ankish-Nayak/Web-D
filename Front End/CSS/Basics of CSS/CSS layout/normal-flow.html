    <h1>Basic document flow</h1>
    <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjeacnet block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>
    <p>By default we span 100% of the width of our parent elements, and we are as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>
    <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of martgin collapsing, we are separated by th width of one of our margins, not both.</p>
    <p>inline elemnts <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one </span> sit on the same line along adjacent text nodes, if there is space ont eh same line. Overflowing inline elements will <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="long.jpg" alt=""></p>
