    <h1>Static positioning</h1>
    <p>I and a basic block level element.My adjacent blaock level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>
    <p class="positioned">By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height</p>
    <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we separated by th width of one of our margins, not both.</p>
    <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit ont the same line as one another, and ajacent text nodes, it there is space on the same line. Overflowing  inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if possible - like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="long.jpg" alt=""></p>
